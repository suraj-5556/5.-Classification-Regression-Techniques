Write a Python function that performs linear regression using the normal equation. The function should take a matrix X (features) and a vector y (target) as input, and return the coefficients of the linear regression model. Round your answer to four decimal places, -0.0 is a valid result for rounding a very small number.

Example:
Input:
X = [[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3]], y = [1, 2, 3]
Output:
[0.0, 1.0]
Reasoning:
The linear model is y = 0.0 + 1.0*x, perfectly fitting the input data.
