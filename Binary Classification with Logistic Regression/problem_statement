Implement the prediction function for binary classification using Logistic Regression. Your task is to compute class probabilities using the sigmoid function and return binary predictions based on a threshold of 0.5.

Example:
Input:
predict_logistic(np.array([[1, 1], [2, 2], [-1, -1], [-2, -2]]), np.array([1, 1]), 0)
Output:
[1 1 0 0]
Reasoning:
Each sample's linear combination is computed using 
z
=
X
w
+
b
z=Xw+b. The sigmoid function is applied, and the output is thresholded at 0.5, resulting in binary predictions.
