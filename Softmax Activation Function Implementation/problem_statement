Write a Python function that computes the softmax activation for a given list of scores. The function should return the softmax values as a list, each rounded to four decimal places.

Example:
Input:
scores = [1, 2, 3]
Output:
[0.0900, 0.2447, 0.6652]
Reasoning:
The softmax function converts a list of values into a probability distribution. The probabilities are proportional to the exponential of each element divided by the sum of the exponentials of all elements in the list.
